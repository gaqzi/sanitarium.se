Så jag hamnade lite hux-flux på Youtube och tittade på olika videos med [mupparna] och upp kom _A Professional Pirate_ från [Muppet Treasure Island][movie], [texten][prof-pirate-lyrics] tycker jag passar riktigt bra in [på][anna] [de][falkis] [pirater][swing] [jag][j-o] [känner][richie]. :)

Några textstycken:




> **Long John:** True friendship and adventure are what we can't live without  
> **All:** And when you're a professional pirate    
> **Bad Polly:** That's what the job's about    
> **Long John:** "Upstage, lads, this is my ONLY number!"    
> Now take Sir Francis Drake, the Spanish all despise him    
> But to the British he's a hero and they idolize him    
> It's how you look at buccaneers that makes them bad or good    
> And I see us as members of a noble brotherhood    
> **Pirates:** Hey ho ho    
> We're honorable men    
> And before we lose our tempers we will always count to ten    


[...]

> **Long John:** Some say that pirates steal and should be feared and hated    
> I say we're victims of bad press it's all exaggerated    
> We'd never stab you in the back, we'd never lie or cheat    
> We're just about the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet    

[...]

> **All:** Hey ho ho    
> It's one for all for one    
> And we'll share and share alike with you and love you like a son    
> We're gentlemen of fortune and that's what we're proud to be    
> And when your a professional pirate    
> **Long John:** You'll be honest brave and free    
> The soul of decency    
> You'll be loyal and fair and on the square    
> And most importantly    
> **All:** When you're a professional pirate    
> You're always in the best of company
